# Riemann Logger
This small library provides convenience classes on top of [Riemann PHP Client](https://github.com/trademachines/riemann-client-php).


# Non-default use cases

## Tagging events
If you utilise tags to manipulate your events in Riemann use ``TaggedRiemannLogger``. This way
you can create different channels put putting a fixed set of tags to every event that is logged.
